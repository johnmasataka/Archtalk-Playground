I want to design a house for a six person family. Three bedrooms are required, the parents may need a reading studio, the kids want a room for play, and they also need a large storage. The house only needs one story.  

Design a two-story family house with exterior walls made of red brick and a roof covered with dark grey asphalt shingles. Include a main living room, four bedrooms, a dining room, and a kitchen. Each bedroom should have a window. The main entrance should be on the south side with a small porch.
